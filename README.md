## Memento
A small app that allows you to make & save notes in your browser locally.
The app has 3 pages:

 - The landing page, not much to see there...
 - The Editor page: Contains a Rich text editor to write notes.
 - The Notes page: Shows every note you've written so far and allows
   you to pin to top, edit or delete any of them.
   
All pages are accessible from the navigation bar at the top.

### TODO:

 - [ ] Add content to landing page
 - [ ] Make layout more mobile-friendly
 - [ ] Add basic login for uploading/downloading notes between devices
