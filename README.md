## Memento
A small app that allows you to make & save notes in your browser locally.
The app has 3 pages:

 - The landing page, presenting basic information
 - The "Editor" page: Contains a Rich text editor to write notes.
 - The "Notes" page: Shows every note you've written so far and allows
   you to pin to top, edit or delete any of them.
   
All pages are accessible from the navigation bar at the top.
A simple login system exists for keeping a copy of your own notes saved remotely and to easily retrieve them on any device.
Any uploaded notes are visible in an additional page named "Backup", which you can copy to your local storage if needed.
